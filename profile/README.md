1 step

Copy the updated README to outputs directory



Presented file
Perfect! I've added a "Meet The Team" section with a nice table layout for 5 developers. You can now:

Replace YOUR_S3_BUCKET_URL/dev1.jpg through dev5.jpg with your actual S3 URLs
Add each developer's name
Add their role/specialty (like "Frontend Lead", "DevOps Engineer", "Full Stack", etc.)
The profile images will display as 100px circular avatars in a clean horizontal layout. Just paste in your S3 URLs and team info! 🎉

All the profile images are now linked to your Google Cloud Storage URLs. Feel free to customize their roles/specialties if you want to differentiate them (like "Tech Lead", "Backend Specialist", "DevOps", etc.) instead of all saying "Full Stack Developer"! 🚀
